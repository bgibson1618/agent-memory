# Decision Log — agent-memory

Why things are the way they are. Each entry records the context, the decision, and who/what
drove it. Discovery-phase artifacts (INTAKE/PRD/NFR_UX/ARCHITECTURE/FEATURES) carry the full
specs; this log carries the *reasoning* worth keeping when those specs change.

## D1 — Work-item recall policy: vendor-scoped, not blanket-filtered (2026-07-21)

- **Context:** The pre-build adversarial panel (`research/plan-review-2026-07-21/`,
  codex adversarial lens, finding #1, anchor *firm*) flagged that ambient agent recall places
  `[work]`-tagged memories into a model vendor's context with no per-use human decision — the
  NFR's "equivalent to typing it" reasoning only covered overt queries.
- **Decision (Brent):**
  1. `sensitivity: work` means **employer-specific material** only. General knowledge learned
     on the job is normal sensitivity — ambient-visible everywhere. Capture guidance: when in
     doubt, tag `work` or don't save.
  2. **Anthropic and OpenAI are approved vendors; Google is unconfirmed.** Work-tagged recall
     (ambient included) is permitted in Claude and Codex contexts. **Antigravity/Gemini-backed
     agents are excluded from memory work entirely** — enforced in the `AGENTS.md` instruction
     block and in orchestrator delegation practice (no KB-touching tasks to the antigravity
     backend).
  3. CLI defaults unchanged: include + `[work]` marker; `--no-work` for cautious contexts.
- **Why defensible:** preserves the KB's core value — ambient recall of job learning, the
  project's reason to exist — while making the confidentiality boundary structural exactly
  where vendor approval is unknown. Costs nothing in code (policy lives in instruction-block
  text and delegation practice); relaxable if Google is later approved.
- **AI involvement:** panel surfaced the gap (`suggested`); orchestrator proposed the
  semantics split (work = employer-specific vs work-derived); Brent set the vendor line
  (`changed` — vendor-scoping replaced the orchestrator's blanket ambient `--no-work`
  recommendation).

## D2 — OKF posture: clean-room from the field contract, no capstone code ported (2026-07-21)

- **Context:** ARCHITECTURE's open question required checking the capstone repo's license
  before porting `okf.py`-style code, "otherwise clean-room the schema from the format spec —
  resolve at build start." F2 is the first feature that could land capstone-derived code. The
  F2 build session is confined to this workspace and cannot read the capstone repo
  (`~/projects/capstone-workspace`), so the license could not be verified from the build seat.
- **Decision (implementer, F2 start):** take the pre-authorized conservative branch —
  **clean-room**. `src/agent_memory/okf.py` is implemented solely from the field contract
  already recorded in this repo (ARCHITECTURE `okf` component row + FEATURES F2 criteria:
  frontmatter id/slug, title, description, type, `topics[]`, `sensitivity`, created/updated,
  `related[]`; body with plain `[[wikilinks]]`). No capstone source was consulted, copied, or
  ported. The license check is thereby moot for v1; porting capstone code later remains
  possible if Brent verifies the license first.
- **Why defensible:** clean-room is safe under any license outcome; the contract is small
  (ten fields + a markdown body), so re-deriving it costs less than resolving the legal
  question, and the schema stays Obsidian-compatible by construction.
- **AI involvement:** implementer selected the fallback branch ARCHITECTURE pre-authorized
  (`accepted` shape, no new judgment call); flagged for Brent's confirmation at wave
  reconcile.
